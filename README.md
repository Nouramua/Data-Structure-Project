## üéØ Project Objectives  

- Build a **modular and efficient** Java system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
- Implement **data structures manually** (no Java Collections).  
- Analyze **time and space complexity** for every operation.  
- Provide **functional queries** to simulate real-world e-commerce insights.
